This would likely reduced the accessibility of evacuation centres and medical facilities between the East from the West part of Derna City.\n\n\nBuildings\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Pre-flood\n  \n  \n    \n    Post-flood\n  \n\nMany buildings near the river and north part of Derna City are completely destroyed after the flood. Evident from the amount of bare land observed from the satellite imagery post-flood as compared to pre-flood. Derna City‚Äôs accessibility to emergency facilities especially in these areas would be very important.\n\n\nAccessibility to Evacuation Centres\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Pre-flood\n  \n  \n    \n    Post-flood\n  \n\n\n\n\nAccess between the East and West of Derna City was completely cut off as the massive flood waters destroyed the bridges connecting both sides, also observed in the loss of road network. This reduced the overall accessibility of evacuation centres between the East and the West part of Derna City. From the accessibility map, initially, areas surrounding the river was within 1km from an evacuation centre. However, after the flood, it is no longer accessible due to the destroyed bridges which are part of Derna City‚Äôs road network.\nFrom the table, we can also observe that around 40% of the building that were present are either destroyed, or became inaccessible to evacuation centres after the flood.\n\n\nAccessibility to Medical Facilities\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Pre-flood\n  \n  \n    \n    Post-flood\n  \n\n\n\n\nFrom the accessibility map, even with the dam being about 1.5km away from two medical facilities, the region surrounding the dam is totally inaccessible after the flood due to the loss in road network within the area.\nFrom the table, we can also observe that there is almost an aggregate of 40% loss of Derna City‚Äôs building‚Äôs accessibility to medical facilities, with the buildings either being destroyed or becoming isolated due to the flood that occurred, which is not ideal in such massive disaster."

The drop in service quantity is due to buildings either being completely destroyed or becoming isolated from any existing road networks.\n\nDrop in Accessibility\n\nA small area concentrated within the flood extent near the river had their accessibility to evacuation centres and medical facilities compromised. Yet despite its small area, its led to almost a 40% decrease in accessibility of these places, across the entirety of Derna City.\n\nNeed for Reinforced Infrastructures\n\nFrom this finding, we can safely conclude that the bridges that were destroyed due to the flood played a significant role in affecting accessibility. In order for the accessibility to such emergency facilities to be more disaster proof, Libya would need to ensure that the road network, especially the bridges, are able to better withstand such disasters.\nWith the same findings, considerations can be made to focus on the need to repair and reconnect the road networks between the East & West of Derna City for a more effective and efficient emergency response. This could help lower any further loss of life.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile emergency facilities (evacuation centres and medical facilities) should ideally be accessible to all, there will undoubtedly be areas with better and poorer accessibility due to their relative distance from such centres and facilities. However, through usage of GIS software, severely underserved areas can be better identified, and improvements in accessibility to such areas can be made."
