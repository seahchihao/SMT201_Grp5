More specifically pre- and post-flood caused by Storm Daniel on Sunday 10 September 2023.\n\n\nOn 10 September 2023‚Ä¶\nStorm Daniel, the deadliest Medicane in history, pushed two dams in the Derna district of Libya to their limits, causing them to collapse.\nThe result?\nA massive flood that led to large-scale damage and destruction of buildings & infrastructure & thousands of casualties.\n\nBelow shows parts of Derna City, Libya before and after of the flood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Before\n  \n  \n    \n    After\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasualty from disasters are tragic.\nEvacuation Centres & Medical facilities exist to mitigate its impact, yet any disaster has the potential to reduce their effectiveness.\n\n\n\nTo prevent further loss of life, our analysis seeks to find out:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†How Disaster-Proof & Accessible are Derna‚Äôs Evacuation Centres & Medical Facilities?\n\n\n\n\n\nData Preparation\n\nBuildings are used as an approximation of Derna‚Äôs Residences in the network analysis.\n\nRelevant Flood extent, Buildings, Roads, Evacuation Centres & Medical Facilities data are extracted.\n\nData Pre- & Post-Flooding are verified through high-resolution satellite images.\n\nLayers are clipped to the study area & saved with the correct Libyan Projected Coordinates System (EPSG:3197).\n\nCentroids for Buildings, Evacuation Centres and Medical Facilities are created.\n\nAccessibility Analysis\n\nQNEAT3 Plugin in QGIS, Network Analysis Toolbox utility Iso-Areas as Polygons (from Layer) are used to measure the accessibility of buildings to the Evacuation Centres & Medical Facilities.\n\nVisualising Data\n\nTo easily visualise accessibility, categorised polygons with color ramps representing accessibility were created.\nWe also used various geoprocessing tools like merge and dissolve, to group common data together for a more comprehensive finding.\n\n\n\n\n\nDerna‚Äôs Evacuation Centres & Medical Facilities are not very disaster-proof and accessibility decreases by a huge proportion even though only a small area of Derna City was destroyed by Storm Daniel.\nFind out more in our poster and/or report!"
