We decided to analyse and assess the accessibility of Derna City‚Äôs evacuation centres and medical services to evaluate the changes in the extent of such facilities effectiveness in rendering aid and medical services in an aftermath of a disaster such as the flood.\n\n\nProject objective\nBased on our motivation, we have 3 main objective for our project:\n\nTo find out the accessibility of Derna city‚Äôs evacuation centres and medical services.\nTo find out how disaster-proof the accessibility to the evacuation centres and medical services are.\nTo determine if accessibility of these facilities are the main cause of high death and missing toll.\n\n\n\nData\n\nOSM Libya from Geofabrik\nLibya Floods at Humanitarian Data Exchange portal\n\nLibya Health Facilities\nLocation of Dams\nLibya Buildings Footprint\nLibya - 250m hexagonal grid and grid centres over city of Derna\nmore data dk yet\n\n\n\n\nScope of work\n\n\nProject schedule"
