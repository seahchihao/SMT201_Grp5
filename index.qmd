# Derna EvacuConnect {.center_heading1}

![](/pictures/logo.png){fig-align="center" width=45%}

Welcome to Derna EvacuConnect!\
The project revolves around the theme of GIS-based Accessibility Analysis and Mapping of Emergency Evacuation Centres and Medical Services of Derna City, Libya. 

## Context

*On 10 September 2023...*

Storm Daniel, the deadliest Medicane in history, pushed two dams in the Derna district of Libya to their limits, causing them to collapse. 

The result?\
A **massive flood** that led to **large-scale damage** and destruction of buildings & infrastructure & thousands of casualties. 

<p style="text-align: center;">
*Below shows parts of* ***Derna City, Libya*** *before and after of the flood.*

## Motivation & Objectives

### Motivation

Casualty from disasters are tragic. \
Evacuation Centres & Medical facilities exist to mitigate its impact, yet any disaster has the potential to reduce their effectiveness. 

### Objectives

| To prevent further loss of life, our analysis seeks to find out:
|               How **Disaster-Proof** & **Accessible** are Derna’s Evacuation Centres & Medical Facilities?

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**

    - Buildings are used as an **approximation of Derna’s Residences** in the network analysis. \
    - Relevant Flood extent, Buildings, Roads, Evacuation Centres & Medical Facilities data are extracted. \
    - Data Pre- & Post-Flooding are verified through **high-resolution satellite images**. \
    - Layers are clipped to the study area & saved with the correct **Libyan Projected Coordinates System** ***(EPSG:3197)***.\
    - Centroids for Buildings, Evacuation Centres and Medical Facilities are created. 

2. **Accessibility Analysis**

    - [QNEAT3 Plugin](https://root676.github.io/) in QGIS, Network Analysis Toolbox utility [Iso-Areas as Polygons](https://root676.github.io/IsoAreaAlgs.html) (from Layer) are used to measure the accessibility of buildings to the Evacuation Centres & Medical Facilities.

3. **Visualising Data**

    - To easily visualise accessibility, categorised  polygons with color ramps representing accessibility were created. 
    - We also used various [geoprocessing tools](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/processing/vector_menu.html#geoprocessing-tools) like merge and dissolve, to group common data together for a more comprehensive finding.


## Key Findings

Derna’s Evacuation Centres & Medical Facilities are not very disaster-proof and accessibility decreases by a huge proportion even though only a small area of Derna City was destroyed by Storm Daniel.\
