# Derna EvacuConnect {.center_heading1}

![](/pictures/logo.png){fig-align="center" width=45%}

<p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Derna EvacuConnect!</p>

Our project revolves around the theme of GIS-based Accessibility Analysis and Mapping of Emergency Evacuation Centres and Medical Services of Derna City, Libya.

## Context

*On Sunday, 10 September 2023...*

Storm Daniel, the deadliest Medicane (Mediterranean Tropical Storm) hit Libya. The rain it brought pushed two dams in the Derna district of Libya to their limits, causing their collapse, leading to a **massive flood** that led to **large-scale damage** and destruction of buildings and infrastructure with thousands of casualties.  

<p style="text-align: center;">
*Below shows parts of* ***Derna City, Libya*** *before and after of the flood.*

## Motivation & Objectives

### Motivation

Casualty from disasters is tragic. \
Evacuation Centres and Medical facilities exist to mitigate its impact, yet any disaster has the potential to reduce their effectiveness. 

### Objectives

This motivates us to analyse and assess:

1. The accessibility of Derna City’s evacuation centres and medical services.
2. How disaster-proof and accessible Derna’s Evacuation Centres and Medical Facilities are.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**

    - Buildings are used as an **approximation of Derna’s Residences** in the network analysis. \
    - Relevant Flood extent, Buildings, Roads, Evacuation Centres & Medical Facilities data are extracted. \
    - Data Pre- & Post-Flooding are verified through **high-resolution satellite images**. \
    - Layers are clipped to the study area & saved with the correct **Libyan Projected Coordinates System** ***(EPSG:3197)***.\
    - Centroids for Buildings, Evacuation Centres and Medical Facilities are created. 

2. **Accessibility Analysis**

    - [QNEAT3 Plugin](https://root676.github.io/) in QGIS, Network Analysis Toolbox utility [Iso-Areas as Polygons](https://root676.github.io/IsoAreaAlgs.html) (from Layer) are used to measure the accessibility of buildings to the Evacuation Centres & Medical Facilities.

3. **Visualising Data**

    - To easily visualise accessibility, categorised  polygons with color ramps representing accessibility were created. 
    - We also used various [geoprocessing tools](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/processing/vector_menu.html#geoprocessing-tools) like merge and dissolve, to group common data together for a more comprehensive finding.


## Key Findings

Overall, we found that Derna’s Evacuation Centres and Medical Facilities are not very disaster-proof and accessibility decreases by a huge proportion even though only a small area of Derna City was destroyed by Storm Daniel.\
