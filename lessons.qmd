## Lessons Learnt

- While efforts can be made to limit the impact of a disaster, the true scale of any disaster is difficult to predict, as per the case of Derna city where the flood was so devastating due to immense volume of water released from the burst dams.

- It is important to diversify the locations of evacuation centres and medical services so that the impact of any disaster regardless of scale would not completely obliterate a city's emergency capabilities.

- A clear lesson is that areas near water bodies such as rivers are often the most prone the heaviest flood damage. As such, evacuation centres and medical services should be situated a safe distance near such areas to further disaster proof of emergency facilities.

## Reflections

- Through the project, we learnt that there are different perspectives and approaches when it comes to GIS analysis, in the case of how our peers had different project motivations and objectives and different kinds of maps and analysis were generated even though we were working on the same theme. 

- GIS analysis is complex and comes with limitations. It takes significant effort to source and clean data. Data may be commercialised making it difficult to access, be even in foreign languages or simply not comprehensive enough for use, in the case of the lack of data on Libya and Derna prior to the flood

- Beyond using quantitative data, GIS is multidisciplinary whereby there is also social and political considerations, as per the case of the scale of the Derna flood also be attributed to a lack of proper management and where evacuation considerations would also take into account population demographics (i.e. disabilities etc.)

#### <ins>Personal Takeaway</ins>

*"I love Prof. Kam and GIS!"* - Marcus

*"GIS is a tedious task but when we are able to come up with an informative analysis which others can understand it is quite rewarding."* - Wilfred

*"This poster deserve a grade E"* - Prof. Kam\
*inferred as E for Excellent! :)*

*"I love that GIS allow me to travel (virtually) to different places! When analysing the impact of the catastrophic flood in Derna City, Libya, I felt like I was in Derna during the flood and it helped me to empathise and spur me to be more socially conscious."* - Chi Hao
