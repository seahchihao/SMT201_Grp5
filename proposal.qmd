## Motivation & Objectives

### Motivation

Casualties from disasters are tragic. Evacuation Centres & Medical facilities exist to mitigate its impact, yet any disaster has the potential to reduce their effectiveness. Considering the high casualty count in the case of the flood of Derna City in September 2023, we decided to analyse and assess the accessibility of Derna City’s evacuation centres and medical services to evaluate the changes in the extent of such facilities effectiveness in rendering aid and medical services in an aftermath of a disaster such as the flood. 

### Objectives

Based on our motivation, we have 3 main objective for our project:

1. To find out the accessibility of Derna city’s evacuation centres and medical services. 

2. To find out how disaster-proof the accessibility to the evacuation centres and medical services are.

3. To determine if accessibility of these facilities are the main cause of high death and missing toll.
