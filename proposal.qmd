### Motivation of project

In the recent collapse of the Derna dam following intense rainfall, there was a high casualty count in the city of Derna due to a major flood. We decided to analyse and assess the accessibility of Derna City’s evacuation centres and medical services to evaluate the changes in the extent of such facilities effectiveness in rendering aid and medical services in an aftermath of a disaster such as the flood.

### Project objective

Based on our motivation, we have 3 main objective for our project:

1. To find out the accessibility of Derna city’s evacuation centres and medical services. 

2. To find out how disaster-proof the accessibility to the evacuation centres and medical services are.

3. To determine if accessibility of these facilities are the main cause of high death and missing toll.
