Road networks connecting the East and West of Derna City were completely cut off as the massive flood waters destroyed the road networks near the river, evident from the satellite imagery. This would likely reduce the accessibility of evacuation centres and medical facilities between the East from the West part of Derna City.

Many buildings near the river and north part of Derna City were completely destroyed after the flood. Evident from the amount of bare land observed from the satellite imagery post-flood as compared to pre-flood. Derna City’s accessibility to emergency facilities, especially in these areas, would be very important and accessibility is likely to drop due to a reduction in the number of buildings (being demand points served by evacuation centres and medical facilities).

- For evacuation centers, we isolated out schools, universities and places of worship to be used for our analysis. (More details can be found in the methodology section of our [report](/report.html)!) \
- Access between the East and West of Derna City was completely cut off as the massive flood waters destroyed the bridges connecting both sides, also observed in the [road network comparison](/results.html#road-network) shown above. This reduced the overall accessibility of evacuation centres between the East and the West part of Derna City. \
- From the accessibility map, initially, areas surrounding the river were within 1km from an evacuation centre. However, after the flood, it is no longer accessible due to the destroyed bridges which are part of Derna City’s road network.
- From the table, we can also observe that around 40% of the buildings that were present are either destroyed or became inaccessible to evacuation centres after the flood.

- For medical facilities, hospitals are used for our analysis. (More details can be found in the methodology section of our [report](/report.html)!) \
- Similar to [evacuation centres' accessibility](/results.html#accessibility-to-evacuation-centres), East and West of Derna City became isolated, reducing the overall accessibility of medical facilities between the East and the West part of Derna City. \
- From the accessibility map, even with the dam being within 1.5km of two medical facilities, the region surrounding the dam is totally inaccessible after the flood due to the loss in road network within the area. \
- From the table, we can also observe that there is almost an aggregate of 40% loss of Derna City’s building’s accessibility to medical facilities, with the buildings either being destroyed or becoming isolated due to the flood that occurred, which is not ideal in such massive disaster.

## Discussion & Conclusion

### Discussion

***State of Buildings***

- From our GIS analysis, both evacuation centres and medical facilities’ accessibility show a significant and drastic drop, especially in areas near the river.
- Our findings are further backed by our tabular data showing a fall in the service quantity of both evacuation centres and medical facilities. The drop in service quantity is due to buildings either being completely destroyed or becoming isolated from any existing road networks.

***Drop in Accessibility***

- A small area concentrated within the flood extent near the river had their accessibility to evacuation centres and medical facilities compromised. Yet despite its small area, it led to almost a 40% decrease in accessibility of these places, across the entirety of Derna City. 

***Need for Reinforced Infrastructures***

- From this finding, we can safely conclude that the bridges that were destroyed due to the flood played a significant role in affecting accessibility. In order for the accessibility to such emergency facilities to be more disaster proof, Libya would need to ensure that the road network, especially the bridges, are able to better withstand such disasters. <span style="color:red;">(**CASE STUDY**)</span>
- With the same findings, considerations can be made to focus on the need to repair  and reconnect the road networks between the East & West of Derna City for a more effective and efficient emergency response. This could help lower any further loss of life.

### Conclusion

In response to our [Objectives](/proposal.html#objectives):

1. Accessibility of Derna city’s evacuation centres and medical services **drops** after the flood.

2. Accessibility to the evacuation centres and medical services are **not disaster-proof** in areas near the river and a huge part of the flood extent.

While emergency facilities (evacuation centres and medical facilities) should ideally be accessible to all, there will undoubtedly be areas with better and poorer accessibility due to their relative distance from such centres and facilities. However, through usage of GIS software, severely underserved areas can be better identified, and improvements in accessibility to such areas can be made.
